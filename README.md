# let's destroy society

These are the instructions on how to destroy society as we know it. The
prerequisite being, of course, to deploy ghosthost to a server.

## Deploying ghostpost

### Overview

Short-term, we're using meteor's built-in mongo and web server. This is
obviously not ideal for production.

Mid-term the plan is to deploy to heroku + MongoHQ for staging + prod
hosting.

Long-term if we need to scale, we have a huge credit at Softlayer. The
dudes rock.
